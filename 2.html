                    <h3>7. Marcos, Ferdinand Jr.</h3>
                    <h1 class="green">Partido Federal</h1><h1 class="red">ng Pilipinas</h1>
                    <p> Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., 64, son and namesake of the late ousted dictator, was elected unopposed into vice gubernatorial seats in Ilocos Norte at the height of his father’s regime in 1980, and eventually into congressional seats representing the same province after his family’s return to the Philippines in 1991. He also served as a senator from 2010 to 2016 before losing a bid for higher office to Vice President Leni Robredo in the 2016 elections. <br><br>

                        In at least three civil cases involving the successful recovery of the Marcos family’s ill-gotten wealth, Marcos Jr. is impleaded as a defendant. The Presidential Commission on Good Government, the quasi-judicial agency tasked with recovering ill-gotten wealth accumulated by the Marcos family and its associates, has so far reclaimed P174.2 billion as of March 2021 — some of which went to compensating victims of human rights abuse during the Martial Law era. Another P125.9 billion has yet to be recovered and remains under litigation. <br><br>
                        
                        The commission has said that the younger Marcos barred government attempts to take back the money stolen by his family, though Marcos claims that he never possessed or even benefitted from ill-gotten wealth. <br><br>
                        
                        Marcos is campaigning on improving the country's pandemic response and continuing the Duterte administration's anti-insurgency campaign as well as its bloody campaign against illegal drugs but with a focus on prevention, education, and rehabilitation. <br><br>
                        
                        His tandem with Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte, the incumbent president's daughter, is formally backed by several other heavyweight political clans including those led by former Presidents Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Joseph Estrada.

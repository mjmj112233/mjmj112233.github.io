                    <h3>9. Pacquiao, Manny</h3>
                    <h1 class="blue">Abag Promdi</h1>
                    <p> Manny Pacquiao is a Philippine legislator who has served in both chambers of Congress since 2010. He first gained acclaim as a world-class champion boxer and juggled his careers as a public official and athlete until 2021 when he announced his retirement from the sport. The boxer-turned-legislator is also a preacher and founded the church Word for Everyone Ministries International, Inc. in 2012. <br><br>

                        Pacquiao has consistently been noted for being the top absentee among lawmakers and for penning a relatively low number of laws and bills. He principally authored the National Bible Day Act and the Handbook for OFWs Act of 2017. <br><br>
                        
                        Citing his religious beliefs as a born-again Christian, Pacquiao has expressed support for the LGBTQ community but not same-sex marriage. In 2016, he drew ire both locally and internationally for derogatory remarks he made about the minority group. <br><br>
                        
                        He previously supported the reinstatement of the death penalty for the manufacturing and trafficking of illegal drugs but, like other candidates seeking higher office, reversed his position in Nov. 2021. <br><br>
                        
                        Pacquiao is campaigning on ridding the country of corruption, criminality, and poverty, though he has not published any concrete policy proposals as of this writing. <br><br>
                        
                        He has said that religious leaders, especially from evangelical groups, will be part of his Cabinet and anti-corruption task force if elected.

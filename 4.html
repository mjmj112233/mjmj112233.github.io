                    <h3>5. Lacson, Ping</h3>
                    <h1 class="blue">Independent</h1>
                    <p> Ping Lacson, 73, has served in the legislative and executive branches of the government for over 40 years. He is currently serving his third term in the Senate.<br><br>

                        Lacson has authored laws such as the controversial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, the Philippine Identification System Act of 2018, and the Reproductive Health Act of 2011. He has long served as a watchdog on the national budget, pushing to delete pork barrel and other questionable insertions during plenary Senate debates.<br><br>
                        
                        Prior to becoming a lawmaker, he served as chief of the Philippine National Police from 1999 to 2001. He started his career in law enforcement in 1971 as a member of the infamous Metrocom Intelligence Security Group that was responsible for the disappearances and torture of activists and critics of ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Lacson denies that he ever took part in the MISG's nefarious activities, maintaining that he worked on cases involving kidnap for ransom, holdups, and common crimes as a member of the unit's police branch. <br><br>
                        
                        He also launched a failed bid for the presidency in 2004. <br><br>
                        
                        If elected, Lacson vows to restore public trust in government by improving the countryâ€™s pandemic response, purging the bureaucracy of corrupt officials, and allowing local governments more autonomy.<br><br>

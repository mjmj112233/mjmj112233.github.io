                    <h3>3. Domagoso, Isko Moreno</h3>
                    <h1 class="blue">Aksyon </h1><h1 class="red">Demokratiko</h1>
                    <p> Francisco "Isko Moreno" Domagoso is the incumbent mayor of the City of Manila. After serving as the capital city's vice mayor from 2007 to 2016, he ran for senator but failed to secure a seat. He was then appointed by President Rodrigo Duterte as chairman of the board of the North Luzon Railways Corporation and later, undersecretary at the Department of Social Welfare and Development. <br><br>

                        Since taking office, Domagoso has focused on improving public health and school facilities and providing low-cost housing for the urban poor, along with beautification and tourism projects across the city. Most recently, he has spearheaded Manila's pandemic response which includes mitigation, vaccination, and assistance programs along with giving out free medicine and testing services even for non-residents of the city . <br><br>
                        
                        Similar to Duterte in 2016, Moreno is campaigning on a platform of "duplicating" his local projects on a national level. These projects include socialized housing, modernized public school education and continuing the administration's anti-drug campaign. <br><br>
